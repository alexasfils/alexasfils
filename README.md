Full-Stack Developer
--------------------

I was born ⭐ in Kharkiv, Ukraine, and now I live in Ragusa, Sicily. I grew up in a metropolitan city and I'm used to meeting a lot of people! Through my experience using technologies, I fell in love with programming. I currently know technologies 👨🏽‍💻 like Angular, React, Javascript, Java, Spring and I have some projects in my personal profile on GitHub. I like ❤️ GitHub, and Git in general. I think it's a useful tool for tracking the progress and history of your coding and professional growth! It is a special tool for all developers and IT community. I try to publish projects here as soon as I can, so that my motto will become my personal - stackoverflow". 💬 I love learning, as much as I love traveling and exploring the world. 🌍
